# About My Project Features...

- First, I built a React constructor for this project and pushed it to GitHub. I made some sections and pushed it to GitHub. I will create a react router, node, express, mongoDB, jwt and firebase install package in my project and i will push in my gitHub.

- The server side created the data for the features section and loaded the data from that server side and showed it UI Design Page .


- The All Assignments page is a public root bond that any user can view all assignments on the All Assignments page.

- If a user wants to update any data from all assignments then that Wazir must be in login status. And if he wants to see the complete details of the data, he must be in the login state . Any user will click on the update button to update the data then a new form will be shown to him and the user can update as per his own choice.

- If a logged in user clicks on the View Details button, he will be shown the complete details related to that assignment in a new route. And will he be able to suck the assignment from that place. For that he has to click on the Take a Assignment button and the data will show on the My Assignment page. Any user will click on the Assignment button from T then a modal will show to the Wazir and the user can submit his/her personal assignment there. And the PDF file can be sent from there. My Assignment page will show this data to User .

- Full page is Responsive in Mobile, Tablet and all others Device
